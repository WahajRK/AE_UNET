Understanding AutoEncoders and UNet

Deep Dive into Auto-Encoder Unsupervised Training Architecture

Leveraging Pyramid Location Network (Pylon with RESNET50) Images for Advanced Image Reconstruction & Defect Detection

Encoder: compresses the input into a lower-dimensional code

Decoder: reconstructs the input from the code

Use cases in dimensionality reductionand feature learning
